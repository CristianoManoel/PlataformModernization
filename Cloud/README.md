# Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

## Five Essential Characteristics of a Cloud Service

1. **On-demand self-service** – if you are not able to subscribe and configure the service without the aid of a systems administrator or outside party it is not a cloud service.

2. **Broad network access** – if you do not access the service over a network using multiple platforms i.e. desktop, mobile etc., it is not a cloud service.

3. **Resource pooling** – If the service is dedicated in some way i.e. you have exclusive use of the underlying hardware or software resources, it is not a cloud service.

4. **Rapid Elasticity** – If the service is not able to scale as demand increases it is not a cloud service.

5. **Measured service** – If the service is not measured in any way, i.e. there is no direct relationship between use and cost, it is not a cloud service. To clarify, not all cloud services are subscriptions where you pay for what you use but all cloud services are metered in some way e.g. amount of storage, bandwidth, active user accounts etc.
